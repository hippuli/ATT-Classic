1.3.3 Release Notes
Contributions made by Crieve:
* Fixed a number of Argent Tournament bugs and syntax for Wrath Classic. Faction Tabards actually used to cost 50 champion's seals before Cataclysm. (gross!)
* Updated Argent Tournament Heirlooms and currencies. Fixed a spelling mistake involving "Gnomeragan". Removed "Champion's Seal" from all non-Tournament vendors.
* Updated heirloom upgrade token prices.
* Updated the Argent Tournament!
* Retail WoW Woes, criteriaIDs changing for no reason again.
* Addon updaters aren't smart enough to handle future expansion TOC files.
