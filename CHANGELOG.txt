0.9.9 Release Notes
Contributions made by Crieve:
* Replaced an explicit removed from game tag with a timeline.
* Updated Tier 0.5 Sets class quests to use AQD / HQD in order to simplify calculating Loremaster achievements for Classic due to how they cross complete but don't count toward the achievement if they don't match your faction. (not finished yet)
* All of the Tier 0.5 Set quests now make proper use of AQD/HQD where possible.
* Holy Diadem might not exist in TBC.

* Dargol's Hauberk, Cranial Thumper, Flesh Carver, and Holy Diadem confirmed by Dejamoo - Razorfen (EU). I'm still looking for a US player to confirm these drops.
