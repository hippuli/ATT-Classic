1.5.5 Release Notes
Contributions made by Crieve:
* Report to Lanthan Perilon is now marked as a Breadcrumb quest.
* Synchronization now almost works with BNET!
* Synchronization now works with Battle.net!
* Since addon messages can only handle so much data, when you attempt to manually sync with a non-bnet attached account, it will first try to link with the account instead of queueing up a ton of addon message chunks.
* Whoops! TimeStamps doesn't exist for all characters yet, just the ones used in syncs.
* Class is no longer incorrectly a function on the current character object.
* Added a SetCollected function that automatically uses AddToCollection and RemoveFromCollection.
* Updated collectible and account wide settings to use a set of variables contained in Settings rather than on the app itself.
* Adjusted SetAchievementCollected for Classic.
* ATT window tooltips will now always include Creature lists if available (a lot of information is determined by what Creatures/NPCs are 'assigned' to a given Thing, so allowing users to purposely hide that contextual information can lead to a lot of confusion)
* Fixed a bug with the RWP collection detection for Tabard of Flame. (and simplified the logic gates)
* A number of collectible types now support the SetCollected function.
* Exploration and Titles now also use the SetCollected helper.
* The linking with accounts feature still isn't working 100%, reverting that last change.
* Removed the missing spell restriction for Inscription. (it was in place while I was working on it, now I WANT to know if you guys know something I don't!)
* Fixed the Magnificent Flying Carpet spellID when opening Tailoring. It was flagging and unflagging it as learned.
* Pre-emptively adding the spellID for the Frost Flying Carpet.
* Only notify when something new to your collection (with respect to account wide settings) is collected.
* Warlock pet spell grimoires were removed with 3.0.1.
* Added Weapon Masters for Classic. (Removed with Cataclysm)
* Added Riding Trainers for Classic Era.
* Removed two unnecessary wow apis for spell detection.
* SetCollectedForSubType no longer incorrectly triggers AddToCollection notifications when account wide is turned on and the character has the thing on their account already.
* Updated the NEW_RECIPE_LEARNED event to prefer a version of the spell without the itemID.

* Fixed a syncing issue where the keys were being converted into strings.
* Some Scholomance BOEs never got removed, just were uber rares.
* Added a shortcut for achWithFaction to simplify the main files. (might be temporary, we'll see)
* Added missing timeline data to all achievements that previously did not use classicAch to whitelist themselves for Classic. Removed the helper shortcut "classicAch" now that all timelining shenanigans has been taken care of.
* Added new version of parser.
* Fixed the mapIDs for Glory of the Raider.
* Fixed the incredibly annoying scrollbar stuck on resizing bug when the scrollbar is hidden from resizing too small.

* For Classic, achievements now automatically attach the necessary runners based on detected fields.

* Fixed yet another issue with the syncing.
* For real this time, I promise!
* Fixed achWithReps and added the Crystal Ward.
* Object localization has been reconfigured to be exported by Parser based on the needs of the targetted database. The structure of the input file (ObjectDB) now supports proper localization structures that mirror how they are done for custom headers. All localization provided by objects is now contained within ObjectDB.
* Removed old style object localization.
* Added a few more mobs for mana remnants.
