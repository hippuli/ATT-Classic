1.4.3 Release Notes
Contributions made by Crieve:
* Updated the format of The Balance of Light and Shadow so that the rewards count as RWP for Wrath Classic.
* Eris Havenfire got a new location during Wrath Classic.
* Added the quest "A Warning" to EPL.
* Added Chrales' Magister's Terrace Heroic Saved Instance fix.
* Stonefirst Girdle now grants Plate completion on a plate user for Wrath Classic.
* Raging Berserker's Helm and Herod's Shoulder now grant Plate completion when on a Plate user.
* Fixed an issue with items that grant reputation. Items used as cost for another quest no longer grant their RWP credit. As it turns out, in the past, T0 was NOT awarded  if the player completed their T0.5 quest despite having the T0.5 transmog credit. This stupid oversight is why I'm now showing you the T0 items again, you effectively have to collect them twice. The second time though you can collect them on an alt or something!
* More cost shenanigans.
* Safe Deposit now requires 6 bank slots for Classic Era.
* Northshire Vineyards and various other submaps from that area now show the Northshire Valley map instead of Elwynn Forest. Added object info for Milly's Harvest.
* Quests sourced with AQD/HQD no longer report themselves as being a missing source Quest in Parser.
* You've Been Served is now a daily quest.
* Tome of Polymorph: Rabbit now has its spellID attached.
* Updated Noblegarden for Wrath Classic.
