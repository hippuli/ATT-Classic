1.5.1 Release Notes
Contributions made by Crieve:
* Fixed achievement popouts.
* ... Actually fixed Jeeves being a Toy.
* ATT-Classic now uses the SCROLL_FRAME_SCROLL_BAR_TEMPLATE if its available.
* The mount, battle pet, and faction dynamic headers no longer rebuild themselves after the first time.
* The Tradeskills window is now silent.
* UpdateVisibleRowData is now window:Refresh. Improved performance when using this function in quick succession.
* The addon now caches "PrimeData" on your current character's saved variable stack. This allows the mini list to properly report your collection while the prime window is uninstanciated. Additionally, each character in your Sync tab will now show its progress, assuming PrimeData has been cached on that character.
* Now using cached prime data a bit more than GetDataCache.
* Optimized SetRowData.
* Currency Lib no longer attempts to show currency as a link, the game lags like shit when you do.
* Modifying the list scale in the settings now triggers a :Refresh() on the associated windows.
* Greatly reduced the overhead of the Currency Lib... Globals are bad!
* Fixed an issue with the indicator icon on rows after a previous update.
* Cache improvements, turning globals into locals.
* Updated categories
* Revert "RELEASE: 1.5.1"
* Fixed Loremaster of Kalimdor.... again. Re-enabled Prime caching.
