1.4.6 Release Notes
Contributions made by Crieve:
* Will the real Glyph of Shadow please stand up, please stand up
* Handbook of Deadly Poison V actually became useless after Wrath, not Cataclysm. (poisons are no longer learned, they are purchased)
* Isle of Conquest likely not coming out in Wrath Classic until ICC.
* Added Key to the Focusing Iris to the respective quests.
* Added missing Fur Lining recipes for LW.
* Sprite Darter Egg no longer explicitly marked as Alliance Only for Wrath Classic.
* Adjusted the coordinate for Aftermath of the Second War in Darnassus for Wrath Classic.
* Updated the coordinate for Elixirs for the Bladeleafs for Wrath Classic.
* Added all ranks of Lifeblood for Herbalism. Fixed a bug for account wide tracking for Bear Form. Herbalism once again gets detected as a profession for characters that have it.
* The quest "Liquid Stone" after Wrath does not require the Stone quest chain to be completed first.
* Badlands Reagent Run II requires Uldaman Reagent Run to be completed first.
* Added some missing objects.
* Annora should now only appear for Enchanters in Uldaman. The OG Black Battlestrider had a Dwarf/Gnome requirement before TBC.
