1.5.4 Release Notes
Contributions made by Crieve:
* Defense Protocol Beta: Trial of the Champion achievements now properly faction filtering.
* Added the "sins" field to Parser. When an instance has a different name than shows up in the saved instances list, you can now provide a "sins" field, short for "Saved Instance Substitutions", directly on an instance in its file. This tells the addon to also scan the lockout data for these alternative names, making it possible to link the raid to the saved instance data. Since localizations are forced to a value when locked, all sins will be checked regardless of language. This should fix an issue for players that play using different locales with the same account.
* The AutomaticHeader now supports quest tracking if one is given a questID.
* ...
* Deadmines is now properly sorted with the rest of the dungeons in Classic.
* Updated the calculation for cost total for objectives to include the total number required. This should prevent quest items from saying "oh hey I'm done!" when they've still got a job to do or you need more than 1. Some argent tournament quests now use providers instead of cost for their objectives.
* Discarded Soul Crystal no longer shows completed when mousing over the object if you haven't finished the objective yet.
* Parser can now execute an OnInit function when creating an object and no longer calls the g function instead of assigning directly to g. (This should help with Classic unflagging collectible states for items when their filterIDs change since their OnUpdate doesn't immediately get called anymore.) You can now reference appName in dynamic functions, objects, and headers.
* Items whose filters change later are now reflected in Classic versions of ATT's database. Added filterForRWP in place of an OnUpdate for certain Mail items that become Plate items later. Introduced the Item Filters for RWP file to properly handle changes to filterIDs for items.
* Keys (for TBC Classic) and the Commander encounter in the Nexus now utilize the new OnInit function.
* Encounter class now supports WithQuest.
* ...
* All windows now remember their positions as well as whether they were open at the time the game reloaded or the player logged out. Significantly reduced the amount of overhead caused by doing things in the game that would otherwise cause an update to the windows. Windows can now exclude themselves from being updated by traditional event handling. Event handlers are now built directly into the GetWindow function and are passed as an argument to the OnInit function.
* The auctions module is once again compatible with the new window updates.
* When you accept a quest, if the quest had previously used a temp name like "Quest #XXX", then it will uncache and allow its name to be harvested again.
* Fixed a bunch of questing lag when having the prime window open.
* The mini list now does a full delayed update when you complete a quest.
* Significantly improved the loading sequence and made it so that collectibles now properly get queued up for collection / removal before playing fanfare. This should prevent those annoying RWP "added to collection" / "removed from collection" messages when zoning into a new area or logging in for the first time during a session.
* Fixed the annoying bug where changing a filter would sometimes trigger the 100% complete jingle.
* Added Glub to Wrath Classic.
* Added helper functions for cloning simple structures.
* Slightly simplified the CreateMiniListForGroup function and added the ability for an object to call OnPopout.
* Fixed a bug where dynamic profession popouts failed to recover correctly.
* Fixed a bug with SearchForSourcePath.
* Fixed Insane in the Membrane's icon for Classic Era.
* Updated the format of Insane in the Membrane to the experimental Classic version. Added BNET account information to your characters when you login to them. (for future syncing features) Removed all options that dealt with automatic showing. By default, frames are now restored that were previously shown.
* ReceiveSyncRequest no longer incorrectly detects bnet accounts.
