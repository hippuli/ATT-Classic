- Confirmed WOTLK Timewalking cache item  
- Added coords for Battle Pets in Korthia  
- Added coords for Battle Pets in The Maw  
- Some BoA Cleaning  
- Couple data adjustments from actually playing the game  
- Update Tanaan Jungle.lua  
- Update Common Rares.lua  
    Moved Weapon from Armor to Weapons  
- Tweaked new seasonal icons descriptions CN/RU  
- Minor informational additions  
- Classic: Added /attexploration.  
- Small adjustment to the minilist replacement logic for BFA Warfront minilists to only replace the minilist if the character HAS the option to change the phase of the zone  
- Re-implemented the map-cache protection with other minor adjustments for Retail caching of coord/coords  
- Removed 'sourceIgnored' achievements from pre-populating their achievement\_criteria symlinks  
    achievement\_criteria no longer self-modifies the achievement and allows the typical resolve symlink handling to do the expected logic  
- Fixed some profession achievement timelines  
- Commented out cache checking for every cache attempt (only need it when debugging something with caching)  
- Retail: Fixed a huge lag issue caused by modItemID cache table never being cleared after being cached... this happens 5000+ times when loading the game... insta-crash for everyone  
- Continuing on the script timeout issue, found out that SetPerFrame changes to a Runner won't actually take effect until the Runner finishes the current PerFrame run sequence... so now an in-sequence PerFrame change will cause an immediate yield to the Runner's processing so that the proper PerFrame value is utilized starting on the next Run. Got it?  
- Added a performance tracking (when enabled) wrap for BaseObjectFields to track performance of every field of every Type, whew  
- Experiencing some weird 'script ran too long' issue and used it to track down a situation where the base stack functionality of ATT would basically break until reloading UI... now when it breaks, it will reset itself and not continue to be broken :smile:  
- Added seasonal available and unavailable to settings legend  
- Classic: Reparsed  
- Classic: The HQT and HAT windows now skip caching map data.  
- Reverted a change made to the map cache. NOTE to Contributors: If there's something actually broken with the old map cache, please DM what the error is that prompted changing this. Do not touch it again otherwise.  
- modItemID is now marked Retail only and uses a post script rather than a runner as to not break the existing caching functionality.  
- Cache now reports when invalid data is getting cached.  
- removed 4 items from wotlk lvl bag  
- Some Dragonscale Expedition Rework and updated BoA/Repitems/uncollectible  
- Achievements > PVP is now fully dynamic, the remaining files have been given a good home in the PVP category  
- Moved all other battlegrounds out of achievements as they can be dynamically generated  
- CriteriaUID's  
- More Cache adjustments for roughly ~20% faster caching on load (mostly via simpler nested map cache tracking)  
- Retail: Adjusted caching logic to only require a single group iteration per group  
- No longer attaching achievementID to any maps  
    Moved map/achievement check from Caching logic into Parsing logic  
    Adjusted sequencing of `modItemID` caching so that groups are not updated during group iteration of caching  
- Couple DF Acct SQs  
    DF Acct unlock quests now included on inaccurate quest reports  
- Couple #errors  
    Missed Breadcrumb warning also takes into account current Unobtainable filters (if you pick up in Debug, it could still report about removed breadcrumbs...)  
    Breadcrumb warning shouldn't post in chat until the name of the breadcrumb is actually resolved (if not cached on server it will still result in 'Quest #N')  
- Humbert's Helm update  
    Removes the Humbert's Helm-listing under Tamra Stonepike as it is a zone drop on par with Humbert's Pants. This also applies to Classic as I can't find any reports of Tamra actually being a source for this item.  
- Moved Battle for Gilneas over to battlegrounds  
- Refactored some battlegrounds files  
- Marked promo mounts as going away in the future  
- Fixed About strings in Russian  
- Most remaining Shadowlands achievement criteriauids  
    Still a few remaining in Zereth Mortis.  All other SL zones should be complete.  
- BRF adjustments to hopefully still work properly based on actual in-game design  
- Fixed Parser error when parser.config doesn't contain certain config options  
- Fixed some parser errors.  
- Fixed some renamed folder paths (@Gold)  
- renamed some files since it bothered me (e.g. promo & character no longer share the number 12)  
    1 item added to doti  
- rfk item  
- Retail: Cache functions for c/r/races bypassed since it's more efficient to let the base class populate nmr/nmc when actually needed  
- Revised 'achievement\_criteria' logic more and added more supported criteriaTypes  
- Update Hillsbrad Foothills.lua  
    Corrects Humbert's Chestpiece's retail source as it only drops from Tamra Stormpike and no longer is a zone drop in this version of the game.  
- Added 'whereMyModID' symlink command  
- BRF converted to InstanceHelper format and greatly cleaned up (-330 dupes)  
    Added Bonus Loot only token drops for BRF  
- Added a Bonus Roll header  
- Added Parser config 'HierarchicalPropagationFields' which allows field values to propagate upwards in the hierarchy when all groups contain identical values for a given field. (Provides minor filtering improvements in game by reaching filter values higher up when applicable)  
- Unobtainable icons should be a bit more consistent  
    Active Holday/Events now show a Green icon (inactive are still Yellow)  
    Battle Pets with an Item will now properly obtain their proper Binding flag (affects unobtainable icons)

    Minilist Rebuild & Update are now sequentially performed across two game frames instead of entirely within one (in most cases, this should make Zone transition changes less of a stutter) [Please ping me if this doesn't seem to be the case for you as well]  
- Fixed for Runaway :)  
- dogwhistle isnt back, but deadmans hand is
